                    I'm Ramona Spence. I build and work on software. <br/>
                    I wrote my first Hello, World! script in Python when I was 12 years old. <br/>
                    15 years later I came back to that interest and graduated <br/> from the Carolina Code School.
                    Apart from building software, <br/>I like to work on game development in Unity, binge Firefly, or Star Wars, <br/>
